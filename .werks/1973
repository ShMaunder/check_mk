Title: Added intelligent host and service type icons to default views
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1422875482
Class: feature

The default list views of hosts and services show a new column, the
type icon, by default now.

The rendered icon is some kind of intelligent icon. It tries to detect
which icon has to be shown for each host or service. This is done
automatically based on the available information, for example which
services are configured for a host or what is the name of a service.

The currently implemented auto detection is far from being complete.
It only contains some examples to show the new possibilites. This can
be extended using icon plugins. For details take a look at the default
<tt>plugins/icons/builtin.py</tt> code.

If you like to change / override the icon by hand, you can configure the
already existing rulesets "Icon image for hosts in status GUI" and
"Icon image for services in status GUI".

You can choose from the PNG icons available in <tt>htdocs/images/icons</tt>.
If you use OMD, the default files are located in <tt>share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icons</tt>.
You can place your own files in <tt>local/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icons</tt>.
