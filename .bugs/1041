Title: cmc problem with parents
Component: core

Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: bug

when running site with cmc, parents of a host are not shown in multisite gui in host status page
even if there are configured some
maybe parent hosts are ignored completely??

if running the same site with nagios core, the parents are displayed on host status page
