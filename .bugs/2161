Title: Visual: single-context views with hardcoded context should not display filter
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2014-09-02 12:20:34
Targetversion: future
Class: bug

Currently the filter is being displayed, with an Warning icon, and any changes are silently
ignored.

The filter should not be visible in that case.
