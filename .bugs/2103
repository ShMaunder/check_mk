Title: Quicksearch of hosts: incorrect WATO link
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2014-02-10 14:24:58
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

For example:
Doint a quicksearch on "x" returns the hosts esx_host and winxp
The WATO context button links to
http://localhost/heute1/check_mk/wato.py?mode=edithost&host=x

Should be changed that it only creates a host link if there is a
WATO host with this name. If not, just create a link to the wato_folder

Best place for change:
htdocs/views.py:
lines following: # WATO: If we have a host context, then show button to WATO, if permissions allow this

Note: checking if a WATO host exist might take some time...
