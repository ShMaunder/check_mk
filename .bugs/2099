Component: checks

Class: bug

The check uses the average cpu usage since start of the process:


***
       CODE        HEADER    DESCRIPTION

       %cpu        %CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.
                             Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the
                             time the process has been running
                             (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a
                             percentage.  It will not add up to 100% unless
                             you are lucky.  (alias pcpu).

This is totally wrong. Better would be to use the raw counter values from ps and
keep an eye on the counters on our own.
