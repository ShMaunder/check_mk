Title: Don't hide "activate changes" button when activion produced an error
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2015-02-10 13:51:03
Targetversion: 1.2.7
Class: nastiness

When a user activates a change in WATO and the activation fails
for some reason, the activate changes button is hidden. The user
needs to reload the page to be able to retry the operation. It
would be better to let the user simply retry the action.
