Title: Bug in staleness on dual config (SNMP + Agent)
Component: core
State: open
Date: 2013-09-11 14:37:12
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2
Class: bug

Host is defined Dual (SNMP + Check-MK-Agent)
check interval for SNMP Checks is increased to e. g. 5 min, while checks of Agent run
default every minute
The problem is: Services checked by SNMP get stale too early
(in this case after 90 sec)
should get stale after 900 sec
