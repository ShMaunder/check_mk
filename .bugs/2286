Title: Implement custom sorting of infos in view editor
Component: multisite

Class: nastiness

When creating a new view, the first dialog is to choose whether or not
a "specific object" should be shown, this list is sorted by alphabetic
order. However, this does not reflect the common uses. It would be more
user friendly to sort the assumed most used to the top, for example
Host / Service.

Same task for the list of filters when editing a view.
