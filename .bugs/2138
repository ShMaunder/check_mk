Title: Multisite does handle state, has_been_checked and initial_state wrong
Component: multisite
State: open

Class: bug

When a host/service has an initial_state configured and the host/service has
never been checked, it is always shown as pending host/service. The initial
state is not handled by multisite.

Livestatus provides the correct information.
