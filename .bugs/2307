Title: Automatic removal of duplicate services SNMP vs. Agent can fail
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.6
Class: bug

Situtation:

Host is declared TCP + SNMP
Discovery is done -> df and hr_fs checks for the same filesystems
Duplicates are correctly removed

Later the host is redeclared as TCP-only
Checks hr_fs remain in autochecks

get_check_table() now does *not* remove the duplicates since host_is_dual()
does not hold anymore.
Config generation runs into an exception because of duplicate checks.

Proposed resolution: If a is is *not* snmp, get_check_table should
remove *all* SNMP checks. Same holds for TCP.

Note: This does change the semantics a bit but is more clean. A
host cannot try to access an agent anymore if it is not tagged
SNMP or TCP resp.
