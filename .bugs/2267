Title: Handle situations with too many open events better

We need to add a configurable upper limit for the number of open
events and handle this gracefully. We could e.g. create a new
artificial event "Too many open Events". If we are in the state of
too many open events further events should just be archived with
a special state "OVERFLOW".
