Title: User setting Disable Notifications vanishes also for admin for permission is missing

Targetversion: 1.2.6

If a user does not have the permission general.disable_notifications, then the checkbox
in his personal settings for this option is not visible. Even if the user settings are edited
by the admin!

Solution:

1. The admin must have the permission to change this flag - regardless of the permission of 
   the user

2. If the permission is missing for the user then the actual setting must be displayed
   read-only nevertheless!

In our case the notifications were disabled but this was completely hidden and only
visible in users.mk.
