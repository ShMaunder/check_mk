Title: Do always create contact groups, even if no host/service is contained
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

The rule based notifications allow the selection of a contact group as
a rule's contact selection. If you create contact groups with WATO that do
not contain any host or service then these groups will not be created with
the Nagios core - and thus the notification will not be sent out. The
Micro Core is not affected as it seems.

Beware: an unpatched Nagios might not consider this as a valid configuration.
If that is the case then we need a global config option. We then set this
option to True for OMD installations and patch Nagios in OMD.
