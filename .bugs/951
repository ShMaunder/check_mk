Title: Folder-Tree Snapin shows foreign folders, but filter does not work

If you create a disributed monitoring then the folder tree snapin
can show folders from remote sites (without alias), which is OK.
But when you click on a folder then the filter does not work
because (i think) it does not know the folder and hence ignored
it.
