Title: auth.serials not synchronized between sites
Component: multisite

In a distributed setup a password change on one site is
not being distributed to the others. Also the file
auth.serials is not synchronized. That way after a password
change the user cannot use his cookie for the authentication
on remote sites anymore.

Solution: unclear. Currently no good idea.
