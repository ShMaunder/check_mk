Title: load_user_file/save_user_file should handle encoding correctly
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.7
Class: bug

Currently in all saved userfiles unicode strings are converted to utf-8 encoding ascii strings.
These strings are not converted back to unicode strings during load_user_file(..).
All strings with umlauts need to be unicode strings within multisite code.
