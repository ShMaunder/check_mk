Title: WATO context button on quicksearch result page broken
Component: multisite
State: open

Class: bug

When searching for a host substring, for example "node", results in a page listing
all services of the hosts node1 and node2. When clicking on the context button
WATO, it displays a red error message that the host "node" (the substring) is not
managed by WATO.
