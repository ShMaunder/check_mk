Title: ensure that the params parameter is not modified within checks
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2015-02-03 11:55:21
Targetversion: future
Class: cleanup

Example check: fritz

    if 'assumed_speed_in' not in params:
        params['assumed_speed_in'] = int(data['NewLayer1DownstreamMaxBitRate'])

This type of assignment actively modifies the params dictionary -> not allowed

How to find such checks:
Make a comparision between the parameters before and after the execution of the check function
Any variation results either in an Exception or an output to stderr.
