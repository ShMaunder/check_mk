Title: omd_status agent section disappears when omd status has RC != 0
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2015-01-29 19:31:35
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

check_mk_agent calls

run_cached 60 "omd status --bare --auto"

to get the status of all omd site in mode AUTOSTART = on.

If a site is not running, "omd status" gives a return code of 2.

run_cached cannot handle this, and no longer produces any results, so that
the omd_status section disappears from the agent output.

Fixed.
