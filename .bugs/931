Title: Cluster requires same agent type as cluster node

Class: bug

If the agent type attribute of a cluster and its notes differs
the check_mk agent will fail

This is caused by the various is_tcp_host is_snmp_host precompiled functions
which return fixed values. The nodes receive the value of the cluster -
thus leading to the checks downfall.
