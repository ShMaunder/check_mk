Hi!

I had also the problem with non working mail notifications after upgrading to cmk 1.2.2.

Custom notifications were working fine.

After reading
http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_flexible_notifications.html

I created the (missing) folder
$CHECK_MK_HOME/var/notify

and switched logging on in main.mk
notification_logging = 1

After that, standard check_mk mail notification was working again!

br,
Marco
