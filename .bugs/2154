Title: Online-Status of users not correct
Component: wato
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

In the WATO users page there is a gray or green ball that indicates
wether a user is currently online. This is assumed to work as follows:

- every time a user calls a page his file var/check_mk/web/USER/last_seen.mk
  is being updated
- If the timestamp in that file is not older then config.user_online_maxage seconds
  the user is assumed to be online

In one larger customer site that feature didn't work. I've changed the value to 10 minutes.
At least 50 users where active, but just a couple being displayed as online. It could be
the case that some cache prohibits the correct update of the last_seen information in
WATO, so that the last_seen.mk files are not being loaded and an old state of them being
used.
