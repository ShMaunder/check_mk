Title: HTML mails not rendered correctly in outlook

Class: bug

It seems that current outlook versions, like e.g. 2010, use some sort of stripped html.
The html code sent by the html/graph mails does not seem to be compatible to this.

We should try to reproduce this on a system and then fix it there. This requires a lot
trial/error - so we should do this together with a customer on an affected system.
