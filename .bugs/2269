When you do a cmk -v on the command line (using CMC) for a new host
without any RRD then only the first RRD is being created. Also the Perf-O-Meter
runs into a problem. Looks like only the first perfdata value is being
processed. Could be some spacing problem when sending check results from
the cmk command took via pipe into the core
