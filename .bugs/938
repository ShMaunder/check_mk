Title: snmp check without inventory
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2013-09-10 15:06:00
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2
Class: bug

The snmp_scan_function needs to be set in order to
complete a cmk -II call. Otherwise the inventory process
exits with Sorry. No inventory possible for check type etherbox_dew
and other checks are skipped
