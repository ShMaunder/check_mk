Title: Invalid reload after command execution
Component: multisite
State: open

Class: bug

When you issue a command on hosts/services and confirm then you see a blue
message with a link back to the view. In that situation there must be no
reload of the view container. But this happens. If you wait long enough then
hosts/services get visible again.
