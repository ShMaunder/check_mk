Title: cmk --snmpwalk does not always get all oids
Component: core

Class: bug

In some cases, on somehow broken devices, the cmk --snmpwalk feature does not
get complete results. At the moment it walks the standard OIDs 1.2.6.1.2 and
1.2.6.1.4.

An option to try to fix this problem is to add the oid returned by .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 .
