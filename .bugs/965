Hello,

when a windows maschine has 2 (or maybe more) logical volumes on one physical disk, only one „Disk IO“ is found by the inventory. When a maschine reboots sometimes a switch occours. On our machines this switches between Disk IO C: and Disk IO E: as they have a C: and an E: drive.

When a maschine has two logical disks each on a physical disk the behavior is not seen.

Sincerly
