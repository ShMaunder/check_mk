Title: datasource and service discovery check
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: closed
Date: 2015-01-30 09:10:34
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

When selecting a different datasource for a host (a shell script), the
service discovery check for the host complains about a missing snmp_info
and snmp_uptime service, even thought the host is not configured to use snmp
(but check_mk_agent with a different datasource).  Version is 1.2.6b7.

In the cache directory of the host, there are two files <hostname>.snmp_info
and <hostname>.snmp_uptime, They contain empty lists. Doing a tabula rasa
service discovery gives us the two additional services with empty check output.

Tried to reproduce with current 1.2.6 code with both, nagios and cmc, but was
unable to reproduce the problem. Please re-check configuration, is the
host really not configured to use SNMP? cmk -D [hostname]. Does it really
use the datasource program?
