Title: check_mk_exit_status does not work for SNMP based devices
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

If you do checks on devices not switched on 24x7, you define a rule 
"Status of Check_MK Service", which sets check_mk_exit_status

For devices using the Check_MK agent, this works fine.
For devices using SNMP it does not work. 
But also maybe a printer (queried by SNMP) may be switched off during
none office hours.
