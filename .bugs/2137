Title: Foldable containers with Umlauts in titles are not expanded on load
Component: multisite

Class: bug

When unicode strings with umlauts are used as titles for foldable containers,
the states are saved, but can not be read/parsed/compared correctly. This seems
to be related to the pprint.pformat() function which writes the unicode string
as key of a dict, but does not re-reads the value correctly as unicode string.

It has happened here with the titles of the views snapin.
