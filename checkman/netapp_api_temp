description:
 The check monitors the state of the temperature sensors for a NetApp filer.
 Since a filer may run in a clustered mode there was a requirement to determine
 which sensors are managed by that filer. The following approach is used:
 If a filer possess most of the disks in a shelf, the shelf is considered as owned
 and the temperature sensors also belong to the filer.

 The checks reports {WARN}/{CRIT} when the configured levels reported by the NetApp filer,
 (e.g. {temp-sensor-hi-critical}) have been breached. You also can override the levels
 with the WATO rule set for tempereatures.

inventory:
 Two checks are created for a filer. {Temperature Internal Shelfes} and {Temperature Ambient Shelfs}

perfdata:
 The maximum temperature of all the sensors of the type in question.
