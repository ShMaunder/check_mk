description:
 This check monitors the data of temperature sensors
 via a IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM). It uses snmp and the
 IBM IMM MIB to gather and interpret the sensor data.

 Per default the check uses the lower and upper warning and critical levels
 extracted from the device (OIDs {tempCritLimitLow}, {tempNonCritLimitLow},
 {tempNonCritLimitHigh}, {tempCritLimitHigh}) to calculate the state of
 the service.

 Alternatively, limits can be configured via a rule.

inventory:
 The service discovery will find one service per temperature sensor

item:
 The name of the temperature sensor as extracted from the OID {tempDescr}

perfdata:
 The temperature of the sensor

[parameters]
parameters(dict): The checks parameters are a dictionary with the
 following (optional) keys:

  {"levels"}: A tuple (warn, crit) containing the upper levels. No defaults.

  {"levels_lower"}: A tuple (warn, crit) containing the lower levels. No defaults.

  {"output_unit"}: "c", "f" or "k", the check will output the temperature in the
 specified unit. If this is not set, output is in degrees Celsius.

  {"input_unit"}: "c, "f" or "k". By default, the check interprets the sensor value
 according to the unit sent by the device. This key allows to override that. Tread
 lightly, as this may lead to a misinterpreted temperature. Should only be used if
 the device reports its unit incorrectly.

  {"device_levels_handling"}: How the check treats the device's internal levels
 versus the ones you specify yourself. The following options are supported: "best"
 results in the best status between yours and the device's levels, "worst" in the
 worst, "usr" ignore's the device's levels, "dev" ignores yours, usrdefault and
 devdefault uses your/the devices set of levels if present, otherwise the other
 respectively. Default setting is "devdefault"
