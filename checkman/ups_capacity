description:
 This checks monitors a UPS that supports the generic UPS-MIB,
 such as General Electric (GE) SitePro UPS, and many more.
 The check monitors
 the time the UPS is on battery (in seconds),
 the battery capacity (in percent),
 and the remaining runtime (in minutes).
 Warning and critical levels can
 be given for the time on battery and the capacity.

perfdata:
 The remaining runtime in minutes and the capacity in percent

inventory:
 Supported.

examples:
 ups_capacity_default_levels = {
     'battime': (0, 0),
     'capacity': (90, 80)
 }

 checkgroup_parameters.setdefault('ups_capacity', [])

 checkgroup_parameters['ups_capacity'] = [
     ( {'capacity': ( 90, 80 ) }, ["prod"], ALL_HOSTS, ["ups_capacity"]' ),
      ] + checkgroup_parameters['ups_capacity']

[configuration]
ups_capacity_default_levels(dict): This variable is preset to {{ 'battime': (0, 0), 'capacity': (95, 90) }}


[parameters]
parameters(dict): with the keys "battime" and "capacity"

    'battime' is a tuple containing warning and critical levels for the
    time in seconds the USV is on battery. Default levels are (0, 0)

    'capacity' is a tuple containing the warning and critical levels for
    the battery capacity in percent. Default levels are (95, 90)
