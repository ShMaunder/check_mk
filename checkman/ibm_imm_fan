description:
 This check monitors the rpms of fans via a IBM Integrated Management Module
 (IMM). It uses snmp and the IBM IMM MIB to gather and interpret the fan data.

 The check uses the lower warning and critical levels extracted from the
 device (OIDs {fanCritLimitLow}, {fanNonCritLimitLow}) to calculate the state
 of the service.

inventory:
 The service discovery will find one service per fan

item:
 The name of the fan as extracted from the OID {fanDescr}

perfdata:
