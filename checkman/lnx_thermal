title: Thermal sensors supported by Linux kernel
agents: linux
catalog: os/hardware
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
  This check monitors the temperature provided by the kernel in
  /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone* and reports values in °C

item:
  "Zone "+(The ID of the thermal zone)

perfdata:
  One value: The current temperature in °C

inventory:
  Creates one check for earch thermal zone.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): This checks parameters are a dictionary with the
 following (optional) keys:

  {"levels"}: A tuple (warn, crit) containing the upper levels. Default: (70, 80)

  {"levels_lower"}: A tuple (warn, crit) containing the lower levels. No defaults.

  {"output_unit"}: "c", "f" or "k", the check will output the temperature in the
 specified unit. If this is not set, output is in degrees Celsius.

  {"input_unit"}: "c, "f" or "k". By default, the check interprets the sensor value
 according to the unit sent by the device. This key allows to override that. Tread
 lightly, as this may lead to a misinterpreted temperature. Should only be used if
 the device reports its unit incorrectly.

  {"device_levels_handling"}: How the check treats the device's internal levels
 versus the ones you specify yourself. The following options are supported: "best"
 results in the best status between yours and the device's levels, "worst" in the
 worst, "usr" ignore's the device's levels, "dev" ignores yours, usrdefault and
 devdefault uses your/the devices set of levels if present, otherwise the other
 respectively. Default setting is "devdefault"
